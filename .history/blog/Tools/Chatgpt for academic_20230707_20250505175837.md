    Can you help me ensure that the grammar and the spelling are correct? Do not try to polish the text, if no mistake is found, tell me this paragraph is good. If you find grammar or spelling mistakes, please list mistakes you find in a two-column markdown table, put the original text in the first column, put the corrected text in the second column and highlight the keywords you fixed.
    Example:
    Paragraph: How is you? Do you knows what is it?
    | Original sentence | Corrected sentence |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | How **is** you? | How **are** you? |
    | Do you **knows** what **is** **it**? | Do you **know** what **it** **is** ? |
    Below is a paragraph from an academic paper. You need to report all grammar and spelling mistakes as in the example before.
