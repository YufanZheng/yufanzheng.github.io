# Research Interest

My research focuses on developing useful tools that help humans make better decisions in different areas (healthcare, industry, public health, and social media) and exploring potential relationships between mass data. Relevant areas include but are not limited to: [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [Network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science), [Dynamic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), [Computational epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_epidemiology), [Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series).

## Ongoing/Main Research

### Data-Driven Models for Epidemic Prediction, Prevention, and Intervention Evaluation

Currently, infectious disease prevention and control and prediction face challenges such as diverse data sources, incomplete data, and complex systems. To effectively respond to the epidemic, it is necessary to integrate multi-source data and adopt a variety of modeling and analysis methods to achieve prevention, prediction, and intervention of the epidemic.

This research framework aims to improve the understanding and control of epidemic spread through database integration, statistical and machine learning modeling, dynamic system prediction, and intervention effect evaluation. This framework is not only suitable for the analysis of high-uncertainty time series data, but can also be extended to other complex systems that require real-time modeling.

### Data-Driven Decision Models for Forest Biosecurity

Ensuring pest area freedom is vital for trade, requiring robust, statistically supported evidence. This involves integrating large datasets from government, industry, and community surveillance, leveraging advanced computational techniques to support biosecurity market access, and optimizing surveillance strategies.

This project aims to create a comprehensive catalogue of forest pest surveillance and diagnostic data collected through targeted and general biosecurity efforts at regional and national levels. The primary objectives are to assess the suitability of these data for biosecurity purposes and explore how it can be integrated and analysed to achieve the following outcomes:

1. Provide statistical measures of pest area freedom.
2. Identify where surveillance or diagnostic data could guide areas for improvement in biosecurity systems/programs.
